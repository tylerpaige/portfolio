I am a recent graduate from The Cooper Union School of Art in New York. Currently, I am a graphics editor at the Wall Street Journal. I am interested in <div class="split-container"><div class="split-left">how text can be combined in multiple forms to create compelling stories — similar to how we discuss "multimedia" stories.</div><div class="split-right">how we can think about websites as durational experiences more like video games and less like newspapers</div></div>

Previously, I was the co-director of an independent art space called 266 W 25 St, which was the address. The space officially billed itself as:

> an open, artist-run space to be activated by a series of short-term projects. [We opt to] allow participating artists to craft not only their projects but also the institutions that will surround their work.

266 W 25 St ran for two years, while we created websites and writings to support these fictional institutions.

Among the institutions was:

- A publishing house
- A convention to redraft the dictionary
- A poets labor union
- A screening room
- The X-Files, as a dance center
- and more

At the same time, I was studying at Cooper Union while the administration was deciding to break a 150-year tradition of free education. I [was](http://localeastvillage.com/2012/11/15/street-scenes-tracing-cooper-unions-history/) [very](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/17/occupy-art-school) [vocal](http://clearingthefogradio.org/crises-in-tuition-predatory-student-lending/) about my politics in this situation.

After [burning out](http://blog.tylerpaige.com/post/49980089907), I went to the Universität der Kunste Berlin and studied under Hito Steyerl.

I finished my education at Cooper Union with an exhibition that explored time, labor, and Times Square. The show was called [Unlimited Liability](http://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/exhibitions/tyler-paige-unlimited-liability-study-shapeshifter). This is the text I put on my invitations:

> If you’re here because you are questioning your right to expect something of the workplace; if you’re here because your expectations of stability feel ungrounded; if you question what essential quality about yourself is valuable, then you’re in the right place. Because think about it: is this the new you?

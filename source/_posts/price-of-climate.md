The Price of Climate is a series of articles that looks at the financial effects of climate change. It’s a sort of different take than we’re used to seeing. There's no aerial shots of melting ice caps. The color scheme isn't ocean blue. 

Our design direction comes from ripping off The Weather Channel, which involved this sexy palette of nauseated highlighter colors:

Anyway, the above images are a bunch of components that spanned this multi-part series:

- [Climate Change Is Forcing the Insurance Industry to Recalculate](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/climate-change-forcing-insurance-industry-recalculate/)
- [Coastal Property Was Once King. Fears of Climate Change Are Undermining Its Value](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/coastal-home-sales-affected-by-climate-change-worries/)
- [A Warming Climate Brings New Crops to Frigid Zones](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/coastal-home-sales-affected-by-climate-change-worries/)
- more to come throughout the end of 2018

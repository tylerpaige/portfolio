**Times Square, Part 3: Broken Clocks**

Why do buildings have clocks? Or I suppose the better question is: why _don't_ buildings have clocks _anymore?_

Is it possible that the public keeping of time was abandoned so that workers never know when to leave the office?!

> My boss is mad. He says, "If Nick can't have it done by 5:00, he might as well not come back on Monday. But I don't know what he means because Nick only works on Tuesdays and Thursdays and sometimes on Fridays between 12:00 and 4:00 but only if he hasn't worked more than 20 hours earlier in the week. _Nick never works on Mondays._"

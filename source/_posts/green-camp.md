Green Camp is the story of the story of Cooper Union's lost green campus: a nature getaway that exists only in institutional memory, leaving current students yearning for its fabled pastures, lost with the school itself. But does the place live on without the esprit-de-corps that fed it for so many years? 3 young art students set on a quest to find out!

> **"I'm so sorry you'll never get to experience that place."**

Green Camp: An A.R.T. Project is a multi-directional slideshow that is sometimes performed for an audience and sometimes sent out as a piece to be read. It is a proposal for a non-linear storytelling of the effects of nostalgia and esprit-de-corps in American higher education.

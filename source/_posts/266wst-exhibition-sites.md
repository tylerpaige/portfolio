(See above for general information regarding the 266w25st project.)

Part of this project's program is to temporarily realize these fictional insitutions through design and creative writing. Often this takes the form of a short-term website. After the exhibitions end, the websites are archived.

Above you can find some archived exhibitions:
- Anna Vila at [The Department of Embodied Fantasy](http://departmentofembodiedfantasy.com/) explores failed intimacy through prophetic technology
- Sebastian Quijada Link and [The 10th International Convention on the Redrafting of the Oxford English Dictionary](http://266w25st.com/archive/tenth-icroed/) explores some alternatives
- Josiah Ellis &amp; Everett Narciso present "Cold Water Trade" at [Basement Economics LLC](http://tyler.click/266w25st/basement-economics)
- Lydia Dresser &amp; Moriah Askenaizer celebrate Oblivia's Sweet 16 at [Oblivia's Parents' House](http://tyler.click/266w25st/oblivias-parents-house)
- The Association of Professional Poets United Incorporated meets biweekly at [Pro's Poetry](http://tyler.click/266w25st/pros-poetry)
- [The Silver Screen](http://thesilverscreen.info) presents a dysfunctional schedule of screenings

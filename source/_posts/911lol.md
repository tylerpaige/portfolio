[Jessica Kuronen](http://www.jesskuronen.com/), [Jessia Ma](http://www.jessiama.com/), and I collaborated on a story about reckless teen hackers, a vulnerable national infrastructure, and reckless social media influencers.

I coded some fun elements for this, like a shaking canvas illustration, custom audio players of panicked 911 dispatchers, and scroll-to-populate collages.

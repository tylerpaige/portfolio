Lightboard is an internal tool for visualizing and interacting with social media data on large scale LED screens. This project provided social media editors with optimal publication times by tracking performance over time.

Lightboard was a collaboration between myself, [Nicholas Breeser](http://nbreeser.com/), [Olivia Glennon](http://oliviaglennon.com/) (who has her own [fantastic documentation](http://oliviaglennon.com/lightboard) of the project), and [Andrew Rehayem](http://arehayem.com/) at The Wall Street Journal.

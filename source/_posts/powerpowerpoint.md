PowerPPT is an open-source jQuery plugin that creates multi-directional slideshows. No longer must your presentations be held captive by the imprisoning linearity of Powerpoint! Go up and down and across, allowing non-linear storytelling within the familiar format we all know and love!

*Currently in development.*

One of those ideas that tends to bounce around newsrooms is to have a narrative follow a river. Renee Rigdon and I came across one such opportunity and decided to make a sort of "target and pop-up" format. Windows cut out of scrolling cards eventually line up with highlighted portions of the map. When that happens, POP the map zooms in.

Generally speaking, it works best when the aspect ratio of the "zoom map" matches the aspect ratio of map target. In some cases that wasn't totally possible, but you take what you can get.

_Mathematically,_ one of the most challenging projects I ever worked on at the Journal. Kind of a nice one to go out on — this was my last project at WSJ!

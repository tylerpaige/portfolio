_A game about Blue Apron!_

My favorite collaborator Jess Kuronen and I got to work with the talented Hanna Sender to talk about how meal kit companies are a logistical nightmare. In this text-based game, readers can make choices that ultimately end up in further complications. Turns out food is really hard to ship!

I got to do some illustration bugs. The theme was like, "Hurry! Capitalism is coming!"

WSJ cartographer Renee Rigdon and I were feeling that AI2HTML wasn't conducive for scrolly-telling, so I built a pared-down version that uses SVGs instead. Now we have a little utility that lets us SVGs (for their layers) without having the text scale with the rest of the composition. 

One successful usecase of th technogloy has been showing geo-political changes over time in a fixed area. You can see some demonstrations of this setup in a couple of projects:

- [How Islamic State Lost Mosul](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-islamic-state-lost-mosul/)
- [Mapping Middle East Peace Possibilities](http://www.wsj.com/graphics/twostate/)

*Hopefully open sourcing this solution soon!*

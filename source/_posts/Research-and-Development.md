R&D is a website that is performed in front of an audience. The slideshow format is completed by a paranoid reading of a script. It is the story of an intern *gone rogue*.

Because of the performative nature of this piece, this website is available only to those who have the link. To request access, please email me at tyler clark paige at gmail dot com.

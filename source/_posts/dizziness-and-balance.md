Recently I have been teaching at Pratt and at Rutgers. I've been collecting my teaching materials—sometimes tutorials, sometimes emotional workshops, sometimes art assignment—to a portal I'm calling "The Center for Dizziness and Balance."

> The throughline between my teaching and my creative practice is to find useful disorientations: misheard phrases that spark interest; quick glances at the clock when a second feels strangely longer; sudden vividness when a truism feels deep. Therefore, the name here is taken from a rehabilitation center seen driving 65mph down the Garden State Parkway—the center between dizziness and balance.

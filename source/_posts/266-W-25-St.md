[**266 W 25 St (2014 – present)**](http://266w25st.com)

266 W 25 St is an open, artist-run space to be activated by a series of short-term projects. We choose not to brand nor give 266 W 25 St a defined mission—opting instead to allow participating artists to craft not only their projects but also the institutions that will surround their work. For every event or presentation held at 266 W 25th St, an institution is designed to best fit the content of the showing. These institutions will shift from one to another, perhaps smoothly, perhaps abruptly.
